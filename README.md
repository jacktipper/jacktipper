### Hello! Thanks for visiting my page.
I'm a master's student at NYU focusing on deep learning applications for audio processing, as well as real-time audio, hardware/circuit design, embedded systems, system-level Linux, and digital signal processing/software development in Python, C, C++, etc. 

I am interested in pioneering new audio software and hardware to make our world sound even more beautiful in previously unheard ways!
